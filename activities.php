      <h2>Structured Activities</h2>
      <p>Age appropriate structured activities vary with each lesson plan, but may include art projects such as magazine collages or finger-paints, craft projects or other planned activities completed individually or as a group.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Free Play</h2>
      <p>Children learn best by playing. Free play encourages children to make choices, learn to share and allows them to explore their environments. Free Play is incorporated daily into each classroom's schedule and may include learning center activities (dress up, kitchen, blocks and more) or other free choice activities such as free art or puzzles.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Gross Motor Play</h2>
      <p>Large motor skills are important to the development of your child. Our classrooms are set up to allow large motor activities like the hokey pokey, six little ducks, ring around the rosie and more. Additionally, our large playgrounds provide a wide open space for your child to run and explore an outdoor environment safely.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Fine Motor Play</h2>
      <p>As your child develops, his or her fine motor skills will continue to improve. Age appropriate fine motor activities (cutting, gluing, writing, building and more)  are incorporated into each classroom. As your child grows, he or she will learn the fine motor skills needed to enter Kindergarten.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Circle Time</h2>
      <p>Group time at Shirley's Mother Goose is interactive and fun. Teachers will use props such as flannel boards, puppets, books, songs, nursery rhymes and rug games to help teach your child. Group time may be in a formal environment such as a rug setting or an informal environment such as a nature walk or kitchen science experiment.</p>
